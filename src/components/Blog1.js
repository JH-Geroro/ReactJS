				<p>Inheritance in very Succulent, which we can learn a lot from Inheritance  An Inheritance is all or part of a person's estate and/or assets that is given to an heir once the person is deceased. An inheritance is typically a cash endowment given to younger heirs; however, any assets can be considered as part of an inheritance, such as stock certificates or real estate. If a will is not in place at the time of death, determining the rightful heirs of the deceased's estate becomes a more complicated matter. </p>
