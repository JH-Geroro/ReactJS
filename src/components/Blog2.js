				<h1>TIMPANI</h1>
				<h4>June 12, 2018</h4>
				<p>Timpani (also known colloquially as kettledrums) are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a head, formerly made of animal skin but today usually of synthetic material, stretched over a large bowl commonly made of copper. Unlike most drums, they produce a definite pitch when struck. This feature enables them to play a significant role in symphonic pieces such as Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2, Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and the "Triumphal Procession" from Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lWTpOH3q8&amp=&amp=&amp=&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Click here to watch the video.</a></p>
